## Blizzard Fighter
***
Blizzard Fighters is the name I gave to the RPG games we have to make at The Hacking Project.
Your Goal is to win by defying and beating your opponents.

## How to Play
***
The current version is playable by only 1 player. 4/5th of the players are AI (random decisions).

* The game is console oriented. 
* The stats are shown on your left, if any problems with it you can reload them with ```watchStats()```.
* A prompt will ask you for your move.
* Every actions will be displayed within the inspector console.
